i am writing this review to share what ended up being an unpleasant eperience with kirk gay and pacific beneficial mortgage to other potential customers i am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan  but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate  so i used lendingtree which is how kirk contacted me my original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing  and  wanting to compete  kirk said he would pay for the appraisal  which he stated in writing  and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have pacific beneficial pay for my appraisal kirk confirmed i would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer however  when i closed on the home  the cost of the appraisal was on my final buyers statement  525  as kirk had said that i would not be paying for the appraisal  i thought i would be reimbursed i reached out to kirk via email after close and got no further response than we paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed i then reached out to kirk two times via email with no response i then called the office and spoke to kirks boss admin who instructed me to reach out to kirks boss  adam carrion  which i did it was only then that i received an email response from kirk stating that the lender credit i received  which was less than the appraisal  was all i would receive to cover the cost  despite the fact that when i was entering into the loan kirk told me that pacific beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and i would be receiving a lender credit kirk asked me to call him  which i did and left a voicemail  and he never called me back i called kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response i then began reaching out to his boss adam carrion via email to continue to eplain the situation only then did i receive an email from kirk asking me to call him  which i did  left a voicemail  and received no response i then called adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did i receive a call from kirk  offering me a nominal amount of money i stated that i wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do i never heard from him i reached out to kirk and adam via email to check in on status with no response the net day i reached out again  voicing my displeasure and that i was going to take action via reviews it was only then that i received an email from kirk accusing me of etorting him i want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was i misled  but i was treated terribly as a customer once kirk had been paid his commission it is etremely disappointing that this brokerage would go to these lengths over 525 after the fact when they promised this a customer read more,Compliment

this process was simple and straightforward  unlike other lenders we were not continually ask to provide the same documentation repeatedly  we were very happy with how quickly and easily the loan took from start to finish  the loan officer matthew mcdevitt was available when needed  but not overbearing  we had a previous poor eperience with a lender that made numerous promises  even in writing  and then as closing approached changed the deal in dramatic fashion  which was caused us to eventually decide not to move forward  this deal happened faster than anticipated with literally no hangups  we would totally recommend guaranteed rate to those that question using an online lender  several trusted sources pointed us in this direction  but in fairness we considered that we dont really personally know our local banker either and lack of facetoface interaction does not stop all types of business we take part in daily we hope to never have to move again  but when we are ready to finance  we will check guaranteed rate again read more,Compliment

i am new to home buying before i make such a huge decision  i like to ask lots of questions  including questions about how mortgages work i want to make sure i am informed enough to at least have a shot at making an intelligent decisioni had asked similar questions of several other lenders who contacted me through this site and they were all very polite and happy to answer my questions aaron however  seemed to have an attitude from the moment i picked up the phone and appeared to become more annoyed as i asked more questionshis general tone was one of rudeness and condescension the conversation ended  when aaron cut me off in the middle of a question and said well let me ask you this  what didnt you understand about what i just said at that point i informed him that our conversation was over and i would not be doing business with his companyim not sure why aaron and guaranteed rate  inc think its acceptable to treat people this way  but if you have epectations similar to mine  you may disappointed with their serviceon the bright side  they arent the only game in town there are plenty of other companies in this business who will treat you better than aaron read more,Complaint
i was preapproved by guaranteed rate after they had all of my information  including an etensive application and full access to my credit information of course  i stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers i then entered into a monthslong process of responding to multiple requests for documentation  everything had been clearly spelled out in my application  but they needed corroboration whenever i sent something  they would call a few days later and say that underwriting required something else  and that it was all on account of the new govt regulations  and note that i was looking to consolidate the 1st and 2d mortgages on my home  and that the total i was asking for was less than 25 of my homes value finally  i received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high  and they couldnt give me a loan unless i paid it off first this was information they had had all along  before they preapproved me in fact  my primary reason for refinancing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance i basically said that their response was not acceptable  and we eventually got it done however  i would never recommend themthe only thing i would give them high points for is responsiveness at least until i agreed to go with them  they got back to me quicker than anyone i didnt go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they werent getting back to me as fast as gauranteed rate once i went with them  however  the process dragged on for months  and they almost werent going to give me the loan buyers beware read more,Complaint
the closing process for a va loan went smoothly  but the loan servicing by this socalled bank is a complete disasteri set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website  unlike other banks with which i do business  the nasb website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entriesfor the first 10 months  payments were automatically debited from my eternal account as scheduled  however  when the escrow amount changed  nasb debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance  unlike every other bank i have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debitednasb sent me a credit counseling letter telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of 40 and change  and suggested credit counseling services  when i called their servicing department  the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was currenttwo weeks later  i received a total of two voice mail messages and an email in a span of 20 minutes from nasbs default department  the woman with whom i first spoke was rude  said she showed no record of my earlier call  it was my problem  and then hung up on me  the second agent  a man in their default department  said that he did not show that i had made any automatic payments and that nasbs system was not set up to adjust anythingafter having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks  i have never eperienced such incompetence and rude service  i specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran read more,Complaint

this loan started off quite well our rep  donna  was friendly and quick to respond to questions she clearly eplained how things would unfold  and it all sounded great what i didnt count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made i had the same problem with this bank 15 or more times i would ask for assurance about something  donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished  and her promise was violated by the bank every single time for eample  in our first or second conversation  i eplained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that not at all  she said we should close several weeks before my wifes departure 11 weeks later  the bank was not ready to close how did that happen donna would ask us to email documentation  which we would email back within 212 hours  depending on the occasion donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great  and the bank had everything it needed then  weeks later  they would ask for additional documentation this happened 5 or more times later in the process  they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now too old i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesnt care about customers  or because it is just incompetent every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasnt kept  donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises we finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it  and if we hadnt pushed hard to get this deal done this bank treats customers with complete disrespect as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks  i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage eperience ive ever had you owe it to yourself to work with another bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers if i could  id rate this bank lower than one star read more,Complaint
