"We had a past experience with Wyndham Mortgage and would without question use again and again if needed!! Wyndham went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money. We would highly recommend Brad Thomka and the Wyndham Capital Mortgage team for your mortgage needs. Sincerest thanks Wyndham!! Ed & Lind",compliment
"We have been dealing with Brad Thomka from the beginning of what started out to be a very stressful time for us, but with the help from Brad and the entire Wyndham Mortgage team it was turned into a happy ending!! Brad and Wyndham went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money. We are indebted and would highly recommend Brad Thomka and the Wyndham Capital Mortgage team for your mortgage needs. Sincerest thanks Wyndham!! Ed & LindRead Less",compliment
"I can't express how grateful I am for the support that Zach provided to me and my family during this home purchase! His customer service, responsiveness and professional demeanor is second to none. He was very thorough and took the time to educate me about the process along the way. I highly recommend working with Zach and Wyndham Capital!",compliment
"I had the pleasure of working with Wyndham Capital in September 2018 as my family and I were making a home purchase in Columbus, OH. From the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from Wyndham was very responsive and professional. I was VERY impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be",compliment
"My experience with Mattison was beyond greatly professionally done!! She really cares about her clients needs! She stays on top of everything and if there was a misunderstanding, she would be on top of it for you. Overall she truly bends her back professionally for her clients. She is a wonderful person!",compliment
Patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure I got the right loan for my situation. The portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. Very pleased with the customer service and intend on using Patrick again when we refinance later!!!!,compliment
"I loved working with this group of people! They laughed with me over the phone! Always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! Knowledgeable staff! While we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed Wyndham, they lost my business because of it. When I told Wyndham about it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the ""sell""",compliment
Great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. Quick responses to any questions or concerns. Willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren't always an option for us.,compliment
"Working with Michelle and Wyndham went really well for me. As a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, I feel that this process was smooth and successful. I will definitely recommend Michelle to friends and family.",compliment
"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",compliment
Jay was easy to get a hold of if I had any questions so that was huge to me because there's a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything's right. He provided as great a service as I could've wanted,compliment
If I had a million Friends I would recommend all of them to Wyndham capital especially to Mark Taylor he’s great he really help with even of the clock thanks a million mark I mean that from heart I appreciate everything you did for me.,compliment
"Chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. Again, cannot say enough positive things about Chaz. Consummate professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities",compliment
Austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. He explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the B.S other companies use to get your business . Being a repeat customer says it all.,compliment
The salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him I'm looking for a heloc specifically. Then he hangs up on me because I said I was quoted a better rate at TD bank. Ridiculous....,compliment
"I worked with Kory and Carla at NASB. They were a superb team and provided excellent, responsive and knowledgeable service throughout the entire process. Ours was a complicated process with a refinance and a loan and they hung in there with us the entire time. It was a great experience working with both of them. I highly recommend them and will use them in the future for all of my mortgage needs",compliment
"Kory was by far the best loan officer I have ever worked with. We were dealing with a complicated refinance and purchase of two different properties and he was cool, calm, professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I wouldn’t use anyone else moving forward. His level of integrity and responsiveness is second to none. Thanks for everything, Kory",compliment
"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him. ",compliment
"The NASB team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important VA home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging Antebellum home that required the entire NASB team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough VA process. I truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. I will only recommend NASB for home loans...especially complicate VA loans",compliment
"Dallas Goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. He was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. We were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. It was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like Dallas. Great job!",compliment
"Comments: To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat NASB but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose NASB because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. Dallas Goodlet/ Brent Custer and the whole NASB team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. We are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. Kudos to all ",compliment
"Working with Jon was such an amazing experience! From the start he offered answers to any questions I had since after all this was our first home purchase!

I've never met Bryant, but you can't mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and NASB were who we were going with. ",compliment

I will recommend him to everyone I know buying a house.",compliment

We were initially pretty skeptical about refinancing our home.  We’ve had personal and family issues that devastated our credit to the point where we felt that it would be a waste of time since we’d never be approved.  However, a real need arose when Dad’s declining health demanded we make room in our home so we can keep him close to us and give him the care he needs.  We weren’t sure what to expect from Patrick G at Reliance, but we were soon reassured and thoroughly delighted when Pat informed us that we were eligible and that he’d walk us through the entire process personally!  There simply are no superlatives sufficient to thank you for your fantastic guidance in getting our home refinanced!  You took what we assumed would be a challenging home refinance and successfully navigated us through the process to a successful conclusion.  In every single step, you proved to be friendly, patient, polite, knowledgeable, professional and consistently available to us.   We can't remember the last company we dealt with that returned calls and emails in such a timely manner!  You even personally called on weekends when there were items that needed our attention!  What more can a person ask for in a mortgage broker?  I will happily and enthusiastically recommend you to others.  Thanks Patrick for all your support and assistance... Read More

I can't say enough about Adam and Pac Ben. Talk about going the extra mile!!!  Holy Wow! Night and day difference from anyone else I considered and spoke with. Adam spent SOOOOOO much time, INCLUDING WEEKENDS, taking my questions, some of which I'm pretty sure were stupid, but he always took the time to walk me through and explain things very thoroughly. He also has a wonderfully calm yet passionate, knowledgeable yet approachable, and charming demeanor that made my mortgage  experience   so much better than I could have remotely expected. Made what could easily be unpleasant more than palatable. 

And above all, they made sure I was getting the BEST POSSIBLE DEAL for my scenario, which took some real work (no one provided a better rate, and you moght expect that ""you get what you pay for"", but not here, not at all 5 star service at the best rate you can get, why go anywhere else? 100% going back to Adam/Pac Ben when the time comes again, and I know it will.

When we put an offer on in our home, our realtor (Susan Lyon in Napa) was not familiar with either Pacific Beneficial or Alex Jocovic and asked us if we were sure about using a mortgage company in Southern CA when we were up in the North. Then the selling realtor tried pushing us to use a local lender…..
After our initial conversations with Alex we knew he was the broker we wanted to work with and my wife agreed so we refused to switch to a local lender and are very happy we did! Alex went above and beyond to get things done for us and was available both way before normal business hours on a morning and into the night as well, including on weekends. 
As our purchase progressed, Susan’s caution changed to admiration as she complimented Alex and Pacific Beneficial to us on several occasions for their professionalism, responsiveness and commented on how easy they were making things for her on the loan side. In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in.
When it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that “This is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company”?... Well, we didn’t and, like our realtor we had not heard of Alex or Pacific Beneficial before our loan search however we now feel that we do have a friend at the mortgage company! 
Thank You very much Alex and company; between you, you made a daunting task seem so easy and everything went through without a glitch from start to finish. We will certainly be recommending you to friends, as will our realtor, and we look forward to using your company for any future refinancing or home purchases in the future.

I am writing this review to share what ended up being an unpleasant experience with Kirk Gay and Pacific Beneficial Mortgage to other potential customers. 

I am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan, but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate, so I used LendingTree which is how Kirk contacted me. My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews. It was only then that I received an email from Kirk accusing me of extorting him. I want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was I misled, but I was treated terribly as a customer once Kirk had been paid his commission. It is extremely disappointing that this brokerage would go to these lengths over $525 after the fact when they promised this a customer.

Everything I said about my loan officer holds true for the company he works for.  The support staff, specifically Summer Anderson was as thorough and efficient as Rowel and as accommodating and informative.  In this day and age of doing business without ever meeting the people helping you - you have to be an expert in sizing up people and their product in just a few conversations or you could be fortunate enough to find Pacific Mortgage.

Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals.  Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals.  She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business!  

Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs.  He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies).  Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees.

Comments:	To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service.

I had a good gut feeling about Triumph Lending, but I wasted a lot of time checking with a few other mortgage companies.

Those other companies were all over the map. There were two I never heard back from after the pre-approval stage. One of them completely ignored one an email I sent as a follow up to a phone call. Another waited a month to call me back. Two of them promised information and ever provided it.

The real prize winner was particularly pushy and was completely unprofessional when I informed him I had decided to use Triumph lending because they're closing costs were thousands of dollars lower.

But everyone I worked with at Triumph, mostly Vanessa Flores (Loan Officer) & Alina Vargas (Loan Processor), took every question seriously, never failed to respond to a request (quickly and accurately), and I know it sounds cliche, but I felt like I was more than just a number to them.

I started a process for a mortgage loan with Triumph Lending (Network Funding) in Houston, TX. I was given a pre-approval quickly with a great Interest Rate. I was continually informed via email and phone calls thorough the entire process of the loan. My representative from Triumph Lending (Peter Lammerts) worked tirelessly to make the best deal possible for me in terms of closing costs and interest rate on top of always being available to answer any questions on a loan that, to begin with, looked like it was going to be an easy mortgage loan to process, until some difficulties on my credit report showed up. Peter was very diligent to work on the issues and was able to overcome all of the obstacles in order to do the mortgage closing on time and with my best interest in mind. I highly recommend Peter Lammerts and his team for their professionalism and efficient service.

Buying a home is complicated, there a multiple parties, and competing interests, and it can be a really stressful and frustrating experiecne. What helps enormously is working with a lender that is upfront about what it can offer and accept, in terms of type of loan, type of property, downpayment, and timing of close.  
I received a call from DLJ when my previous lender changed terms on me two weeks into escrow, and in desperation I had filled out the Lending Tree form in the hope if finding a new lender. 
At the time, I honestly thought my purchase was going to fall through. 
The next day I received a call from a number and a lender I didn't recognize. It was DLJ. Am I glad I answered the phone!
Within minutes, Adan Munoz had me back on track. DLJ's team was, across the board, knowledgable, articulate, well-coordinated, calm and constructive. They offered a product that met my needs perfectly, and got me across the finish line in record time.

Recently, I successfully financed a home loan through DLJ Financial and  Senior Mortgage Banker Anthony Marroquin. I had discovered that traditional banks and online financing companies were impossible for me to work with because they held against me my record of variable income (I am a self-employed freelancer and a multi-Emmy-winning Reality TV producer who works for more than a decade on a #1 major network series.) However, DLJ carefully evaluated everything, treated me as a unique person rather than just a bunch of standard numbers to be crunched and averaged, and they made it all happen - straightforwardly, fully explained, and with no glitches.

ANTHONY MARROQUIN patiently and thoroughly fully explained everything to me step by step from start to finish while exploring all options for the best results.

I worked with Sam on a home purchase. Not only did he provide me with a low interest rate / low closing costs; the process itself, was seamless. He was detailed in his explanation of the mortgage process, introduced me to everyone on his team (who were all wonderful as well), and my loan was clear to close way ahead of schedule. My realtor and my attorney were super impressed with the service he provided me. I recommend him to everyone I know who is looking for a mortgage... Read More

I spent weeks working with numerous brand name banks and lending intuitions to refinance my home. I assumed this came after a particularly opportune time, as I just completed a full cycle in my full-time employment position. I had all the documents uploaded within a day or 2.  My income, credit score, 401K balances were all quite respectable. However, rather than being met with the highest degree of professionalism, I was met with stumbling blocks of bureaucracy.

Then I was very fortunate to find Michael and his most dedicated professional staff at Guaranteed Rate. I was prepared once again for anything, other than the professionalism, sensitivity, and quick (and at the same time responsible) turnaround I immediately received.

The closing costs, title insurance, etc. were the lowest I have ever seen.

I closed this week, original mortgage paid off, money in my account, all with the most respectable and free flowing experience imaginable. 

Thank you, Michael and crew.

This process was simple and straight-forward.  Unlike other lenders we were not continually ask to provide the same documentation repeatedly.  We were very happy with how quickly and easily the loan took from start to finish.  The loan officer Matthew McDevitt was available when needed, but not overbearing.  We had a previous poor experience with a lender that made numerous promises, even in writing, and then as closing approached changed the deal in dramatic fashion, which was caused us to eventually decide not to move forward.  This deal happened faster than anticipated with literally no hang-ups.  We would totally recommend Guaranteed Rate. To those that question using an online lender, several trusted sources pointed us in this direction, but in fairness we considered that we don't really personally know our local banker either and lack of face-to-face interaction does not stop all types of business we take part in daily. We hope to never have to move again, but when we are ready to finance, we will check Guaranteed Rate again.

I couldn't have been more pleased with Aaron's customer service. My father recommended Aaron when I was looking to buy a house. Aaron fought to get me the best rate and made sure that everything went as planned. When I wasn't able to move my closing date up to keep my rate interest rate, Aaron told me not to worry about it and he would cover the cost difference. He did the same thing when we had to pay extra to rush the appraiser to close on time. I would and will recommend Aaron to anyone looking to buy a home because I know he will do a great job like he did for me.... Read More

He is great at what he does and will personally ensure your closing is on time.

Not happy.!!! Buyer beware!! To make it short and sweet, shop around and find someone who knows what they are talking about. 
There were certain expenses that I had to pay before closing, but was assured I would get a refund, or Reliance would pay for it and it would reflect in the final closing documents. This did not happen. 
Termite inspection required by VA, was $100+. I was told I would get this back. Nope. Her answer, 'Oh, the rules changed some time back, and I didn't know about it'. 
Was also told, if it closed late, which it did, Reliance would pick up the late fee for my present mortgage which she told me not to pay. Yep, they paid it, with my proceeds!!
Then to pay off the loan, which was the reason for the refinance, they send me a check payable to the lender, and then I have to overnight it to the lender so i don't get hit with another late fee. WHY??? Could't they just do an electronic payment.

Probably this was a more challenging refinance. Alex Zelada worked very had on this!
But despite numerous assurances of getting close to the finish line, it took over 3 months , and the 45 day rate lock had to be extended.
Most of the problem seemed to be with Quicken. Requests for documents was piecemeal, and each new request caused a delay; this most likely due to Quicken, and Q did put everything in a holding pattern, apparently without the brokers' knowledge. It was discovered only after my following up to see what the delay was .
Also there were a few instances of PB staff not fully reading thru correspondence and making assumptions that weren't entirely accurate and could have been significant to the borrower.

I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation... Read More

It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them. Of the four houses I purchased in the past 9 years this was the most stressful... Read More

What a horrible experience. We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch... Read More

I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning. I expected honest communication from a loan consultant from NASB bank and I did not receive that. I am very disappointed... Read More

The Interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite -
1. the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per VA rules for an IRRRL these were not necessary and we were assured by Mr. Owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made. 
2. the constant errors in the paperwork. One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.
3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB's intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there ""just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future."" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn't definite. 
4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent's place of business.
Pros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the ""despites"" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.

Good News:

The $995 processing fee was waived.
The rate was locked for 35 days but they closed in 9 weeks, I did not have to pay for an extension.
They have also floated my rate down 1/8 percent without any fees.
Until the closing I did not pay anything other than a credit history check fee.

Not so good news:

This was a very long and frustrating experience.
I do believe that the process took longer than expected mostly because of the busy refinance season.
I might be a difficult customer or may be just unlucky but there was always a problem with every stage and detail of my refinance experience.
I am trying not to blame the ""loan consultant"" (BYRON HOUSWORTH) for this.

Whenever I asked about any time line, the answer was fixed ""in a week or so"". I had to wait for 9 (nine) weeks to close.

It was my luck that his vacation week was in the middle of my process.

If NASB needs a document they will wait until the last minute and then come back ""oh we need this document or else we can't continue""
When you have that one taken care of, they will wait ""a week or so"" to get back to you and next week you will hear ""it turns out we also need this document""
This went on and on, the day before the closing they would email me and say ""we just noticed that we didn't have your employment verification done"", hours before closing,
""oh we just found out that we don't have your home insurance verification and we can't reach them""
I called the insurance company and in ten minutes it was taken care of.

I don't know how many times I had to hear ""this should be OK"" and turns out it is not OK.

Many many times they assured me they have all the information they need - but this was never the case.

They were not very careful, they missed out all the details, they wasted weeks and weeks because they were not able to go through a check list and see if they have taken care of everything.

They always say ""we are too busy with a lot of applications"". I believe they shouln't accept applications that they can't process.

Sample communication:

me: Why am I being charged for such and such?
respond: We are not charging you for that.
me: Please check the final HUD line XX
respond: Sorry I didn't go down that far.
me: ???

Some of my favorite quotes from them:
""Sorry! Don't come across this too often. ""
""Wasn't aware of that...""
""This should work.""
""Can you possibly call them again? We need it ASAP.""
""Thank you for your patience.""
""TGIF!"" --(I had to hear this 8-9 times)

They are not bad people, but you need a lot of patience dealing with them.

Do I suggest working with them?
Only if you are not under any time pressure.
Only if you can work hard for your own application.
Only if you have a lot of patience.

Overall, I feel like NASB is an OK bank to work with. But I don't think I could handle this hassle again... Read More

This closing went pretty smooth with the exception of a few bumps. The customer service agent was prompt with responses as well as document transfers. I was not keen on doing a refinance all electronic through email and phone, but I have to say, the process was easy and went well. I got a great rate and the closing costs were good.

The only issue I had was at closing, the final documents were written for a 30 year loan and it was suppose to be a 25 year loan, An issue happened at the final writing so I did not close on the specified closing date, it happened a day later after the papers were rewritten. It was great they were able to resolve it in one day, the bad part was I got charged a rate lock extension fee as my rate lock expired on the day I was suppose to close.

While William was fine, my loan officer, and was at times very good; this entire experience was horrible when it came down to the actual processing and closing. The underwriter did not tell me about additional items needed until the very last week before closing, and I feel that she should have been able to give me that list when I called to check status 2 to 2 1/2 weeks prior. At that point I was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal. I live in Hawaii and buying here means that there is a 4 day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual. The items she was demanding would take 10-14 business days to get and I had already purchased my airline ticket, shipped my vehicle and household goods. There was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of GOD and I would have to bow her will. The company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes I had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare. They only care when it comes to getting your MONEY! With buying being stressful as it is, this was uncalled for from the companies side and they need to reevaluate their processes and get the understanding of what real customer service is- it is RESPECT of the customer and their time and lives!

Positive: Completed mortgage refinance reducing my APR from 5.25% to 3.5%

However: The 3.5% rate was available at several competitors, several of whom offered lower fees. I was also refinancing to reinstate my VA Certificate of Eligibility toward purchase of a home. Since the rate was available elsewhere, I hired GR based on the broker's claim that the transaction could be completed within 4-5 weeks or less. I formally began the process with Guaranteed Rate on July 2. Based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on July 23rd, we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for 1 month later and I alerted VA. This refinance didn't close with GR until a full month later (Aug 23) and the loan was funded on Aug 27. I came within 2 days of missing a rate-lock date on the other new-home purchase mortgage because of this.

Communications from the broker was horrible. As I mentioned, in parallel with this effort, I was going through the process of obtaining a home purchase mortgage from another company, so I have a great basis of comparison. I received no information from Guaranteed Rate without having to ask for it. When I did receive information, it was minimal (typically ""yes"" or ""no"" answer), so I had to follow-up with additional questions to get clarification on details (I don't do this for a living, that's why I hired GR! I definitely did NOT receive my money's worth).

If I'm to believe the broker, my loan package spent 4 1/2 weeks in underwriting. BTW, my credit scores are all above 770, so there was no issue there. When asked, the broker never offered any rationale for the delay.

When asked by GR, I sent this same review two weeks ago. Surprise - I haven't heard a word back from them apologizing for their complete lack of customer service.

Trust me, you can do better than these guys... Read More

I am new to home buying. Before I make such a huge decision, I like to ask lots of questions, including questions about how mortgages work. I want to make sure I am informed enough to at least have a shot at making an intelligent decision.

I had asked similar questions of several other lenders who contacted me through this site and they were all very polite and happy to answer my questions. Aaron however, seemed to have an attitude from the moment I picked up the phone and appeared to become more annoyed as I asked more questions.

His general tone was one of rudeness and condescension. The conversation ended, when Aaron cut me off in the middle of a question and said ""well let me ask you this, what didn't you understand about what I just said?"" At that point I informed him that our conversation was over and I would not be doing business with his company.

I'm not sure why Aaron and Guaranteed Rate, Inc. think it’s acceptable to treat people this way, but if you have expectations similar to mine, you may disappointed with their service.

I was ""pre-approved"" by Guaranteed Rate after they had all of my information, including an extensive application and full access to my credit information. Of course, I stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers. I then entered into a months-long process of responding to multiple requests for documentation; everything had been clearly spelled out in my application, but they needed corroboration. Whenever I sent something, they would call a few days later and say that ""Underwriting"" required something else; and that it was all on account of the new govt. regulations. (And note that I was looking to consolidate the 1st and 2d mortgages on my home, and that the total I was asking for was less than 25% of my home's value.)

Finally, I received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high, and they couldn't give me a loan unless I paid it off first. This was information they had had all along, before they ""pre-approved"" me. In fact, my primary reason for re-financing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance. I basically said that their response was not acceptable; and we eventually got it done. However, I would never recommend them.

The only thing I would give them high points for is responsiveness. At least until I agreed to go with them, they got back to me quicker than anyone. I didn't go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren't getting back to me as fast as Gauranteed Rate. Once I went with them, however, the process dragged on for months; and they almost weren't going to give me the loan. Buyers Beware... Read More

The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly.  But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster.

I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website.  Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries.

For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled.  However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited.

NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services.  When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current.

Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department.  

The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me.  The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything.

After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service.

This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had.

I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation... Read More

It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them. Of the four houses I purchased in the past 9 years this was the most stressful... Read More

What a horrible experience. We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch... Read More

I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning. I expected honest communication from a loan consultant from NASB bank and I did not receive that. I am very disappointed... Read More
